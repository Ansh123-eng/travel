              Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island, is an island of the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the South Andaman administrative district, Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The island is situated 3 km (2 mi) east from central Port Blair. The historic ruins are a tourist attraction.Ross island was named after marine surveyor, Daniel Ross. In December 2018, it was renamed as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Island as a tribute to Indian freedom fighter Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.The island belongs to the Port Blair Islands and lies in the entrance of Port Blair.Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Island has thick forests. To any onlooker it may give the impression that it has no "life" — in the sense that there is no human habitation. Spotted Deer and peacocks are mostly found in the island and the island is full of palm and coconut trees.There is a pathway up to the northern end of the Island, where the new concrete 10 m high circular lighthouse Tower was constructed in 1977, on an offshoot rock about 50 metres (160 ft) away from the shore line. The tower is approachable during the low tide. It was at this lighthouse that photo voltaic panels were introduced for the first time in India, to charge the batteries for the operation of light.
