              gate, the "Tripolia" with eight marble porticos, The Maharanas were weighed under the gate in gold, the equivalent amount of which was distributed among the populace. The surajgokhada, the balcony of the sun, is where the SuryanshiMaharanas of Mewar
              presented themselves to the people in the time of trouble to restore their confidence. The 'MorChowk' known for its exquisite peacock mosaics in glass and the 'ChiniChitrashala' noted for its blue and white ceramics are other attractions in the palace. A high tech sound and light show is conducted every evening at the magnificent ManakChowk which brings
              alive the rich history of Mewar. The palace of Udaipur is a glorious symbol of Mewar.

              The Monsoon Palace, also known as the Sajjan Garh Palace, is a hilltop palatial residence in the city of Udaipur, Rajasthan in India, overlooking the Fateh Sagar Lake. It is named Sajjangarh after Maharana Sajjan Singh (1874-1884) of the Mewar dynasty, whom it was built for in 1884. The palace offers a panoramic view of the city's lakes, palaces and surrounding countryside. It was built chiefly to watch the monsoon clouds; hence, appropriately, it is popularly known as Monsoon Palace. It is said that the Maharana built it at the top of the hill to get a view of his ancestral home, Chittorgarh. Previously owned by the Mewar royal family, it is now under the control of the Forest Department of the Government of Rajasthan and has recently been opened to the public. The palace provides a beautiful view of the sunset. Its builder, Maharana Sajjan Singh, originally planned to make it a five-storey astronomical centre. The plan was cancelled with Maharana Sajjan Singh's premature death. It was then turned into a monsoon palace and hunting lodge. High in the Aravalli Hills, just outside Udaipur, the palace is illuminated in the evenings, giving a golden orange glow. The palace appeared in the 1983 James Bond film Octopussy as the residence of Kamal Khan (Portrayed by Louis Jourdan), an exiled Afghan prince.

              Lake Pichola, situated in Udaipur city in the Indian state of Rajasthan, is an artificial fresh water lake, created in the year 1362, named after the nearby Picholi village. It is one of the several contiguous lakes, and developed over the last few centuries in and around the famous Udaipur city. The lakes around Udaipur were primarily created by building dams to meet the drinking water and irrigation needs of the city and its neighbourhood. Two islands, Jag Niwas and Jag Mandir are located within Pichola Lake, and have been developed with several palaces to provide views of the lake.
              There are four islands on the lake:<br>
              - Jag Niwas, where the Lake Palace is built.<br>
              - Jag Mandir, with the palace of the same name.<br>
              - Mohan Mandir, from where the king would watch the annual Gangaur festival celebration.<br>
              - Arsi Vilas, small island which was an ammunition depot, but also a small palace. This one was built by one of the Maharanas of Udaipur to enjoy the sunset on the lake. It is also a sanctuary catering to a variety of birds, including tufted ducks, coots, egrets, terns, cormorants and kingfishers.<br>
              Three of the numerous lakes found in the vicinity of Udaipur which connect with the Pichola lake and the Swaroop Sagar Lake connected by an arched bridge built by Maharana Swaroop Singh (1842-1861) which in turn connects to the Fateh Sagar Lake, the crystal watered lake in the midst of tree lined hills and the smaller Arsi Vilas.Lake Pichola is approachable by road from Udaipur City. Local buses, Tongas, auto-rickshaws and taxis provide the needed transport. The lake is adjacent to the Bagore Ki Haveli museum, making it a good landmark.
